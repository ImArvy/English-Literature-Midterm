I did not have to please anyone by conjuring up Alexander the Great from the dead, I was able to go to bed every night without the possibility of some lunatic hourse-courser taking my leg, and, best of all, I even walked into the hotel without the worry of being ambushed and decapitated by that vengeful Benvolio! I hope to come back here before my time runs out.'}
